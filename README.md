# Documentation
### Documentation for Visual Memory independent study with Prof. Chris Heckman.
#### The aim of this Independent Studies was to

- Get familiar with ROS and PyTorch. ✅
- Explore [Gibson Simulator](http://gibsonenv.stanford.edu/). **(Partially done)**
- Create an *end-to-end* deep neural network with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as feature extractor and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for learning optimal policy just based on visual data and no prior mapping of the environment. ✅
- Gather training data using Gibson or an actual robot (Movo in our case). ✅
